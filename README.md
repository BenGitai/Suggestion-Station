**Note:** This code was entirely AI‐generated as part of an Algorithm class assignment.

Overview
--------
Stuck‐Picker is a console‐based Java application designed to help users overcome decision paralysis. Users select from CSV‐backed lists (e.g. movies, food, TV shows), and the app randomly suggests an item based on a weighted preference algorithm. When an item is “liked” or “disliked,” its score is adjusted accordingly—and every other item that shares at least one tag is given a smaller score adjustment. All scores are persisted back into the CSV files so that future sessions reflect updated preferences.

Key Features
------------
1. **External CSV Lists**  
   - Each list is a CSV file in the `data/` folder.  
   - Format per line:  
     ```
     name,tags[,score]
     ```  
     • `name` = item name (e.g. “Inception”)  
     • `tags` = semicolon‐separated tags (e.g. `Movie;SciFi;Action`)  
     • `score` = optional numeric value (if missing, defaults to 0.0)

2. **Category (Tag) Management**  
   - Tags are automatically extracted from every CSV row.  
   - For each unique tag, a `Category` object is created.  
   - Items appear in all categories corresponding to their tag list.

3. **Weighted‐Random Selection**  
   - Each item’s weight = `(rawScore + 1.0)`, clamped to a minimum of 0.1.  
   - Random selection is proportional to weight.  
   - Negative scores decrease selection probability but never reach zero.

4. **Preference Propagation**  
   - When the user “likes” an item:  
     • Primary item’s score `+= 1.0`  
     • Every other item sharing at least one tag `+= 0.2`  
   - When the user “dislikes” an item:  
     • Primary item’s score `-= 1.0` (clamped at –0.9)  
     • Every other item sharing at least one tag `-= 0.2` (clamped at –0.9)  
   - All affected CSV rows are immediately overwritten to persist new scores.

5. **Item Skipping Logic**  
   - If a user “skips” a suggestion, the item is added to a temporary skip set.  
   - Skipped items are not eligible for re‐selection until the user “accepts” another item or exits the file.  
   - When all items in the file have been skipped without acceptance, the app returns to file selection.

6. **List Management (Create/Edit)**  
   - From the main menu, enter `manage` to create or edit CSV lists.  
   - **Create New List**:  
     • Choose a new filename (e.g. `mylist.csv`)  
     • Enter any number of items (`name` + `tags`) until blank input  
     • A new CSV is written with header `name,tags,score`.  
   - **Edit Existing List**:  
     • Select from a numbered list of existing CSV filenames.  
     • Options to add, remove, or view items (each row = `name,tags,score`).  
     • After editing, the CSV is overwritten with updated rows.

7. **Persistence**  
   - Every CSV rewrite happens immediately when scores change or when a user edits a list.  
   - On application startup, all CSVs are scanned, parsed, and loaded into memory with their current scores.

8. **AI‐Generated Code**  
   - All Java source files (`Main.java`, `PreferenceEngine.java`, `Item.java`, `Category.java`) were generated by an AI model to fulfill the requirements of an Algorithm class assignment.

CSV File Requirements
---------------------
- **Location**: All CSV files must reside in the `data/` directory at the project root.  
- **Filename**: Must end with `.csv`.  
- **Header**: The first line can be `name,tags,score` or `name,tags`. If the header only has two columns, the code will automatically insert a `score` column on load.  
- **Rows**:
Item Name,Tag1;Tag2;Tag3,0.0

• If `score` is omitted, that row’s score defaults to `0.0`.  
• Tags must be semicolon‐separated, with no extra commas.

How to Compile and Run
----------------------
1. **Java Version**  
 - Requires Java 8 or higher.

2. **Compile**  
 From the project root:
 ```bash
 javac -d out src/*.java
 ```

3. **Run**
 ```bash
 java -cp out Main    
 ```
